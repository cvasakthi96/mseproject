              The marine pelagic environment is the largest aquatic habitat on Earth, occupying 1,370 million cubic kilometres (330 million cubic miles), and is the habitat for 11 percent of known fish species. The oceans have a mean depth of 4000 metres. About 98 percent of the total water volume is below 100 metres, and 75 percent is below 1000 metres. 
              </p>
              <p align="justify">Marine pelagic fish can be divided into pelagic coastal fish and oceanic pelagic fish. Coastal fish inhabit the relatively shallow and sunlit waters above the continental shelf, while oceanic fish (which may well also swim inshore) inhabit the vast and deep waters beyond the continental shelf. 
              Pelagic fish range in size from small coastal forage fish, such as herrings and sardines, to large apex predator oceanic fishes, such as the Southern bluefin tuna and oceanicsharks. They are usually agile swimmers with streamlined bodies, capable of sustained cruising on long distance migrations. </p>
            <p align="justify">The Indo-Pacific sailfish, an oceanic pelagic fish, can sprint at over 110 kilometres per hour. Some tuna species cruise across the Pacific Ocean. Many pelagic fish swim in schools weighing hundreds of tonnes. Others are solitary, like the largeocean sunfish weighing over 500 kilograms, which sometimes drift passively with ocean currents, eating jellyfish. </p></td>

              Oceanic fish (also called open ocean or offshore fish) live in the waters that are not above the continental shelf. Oceanic fish can be contrasted with coastal fish, which do live above the continental shelf. However, the two types are not mutually exclusive, since there are no firm boundaries between coastal and ocean regions, and many epipelagic fish move between coastal and oceanic waters, particularly in different stages in their life cycle.
              Oceanic epipelagic fish can be true residents, partial residents, or accidental residents.</p>
              <p align="justify">True residents live their entire life in the open ocean. Only a few species are true residents, such as tuna, billfish, flying fish, sauries, commercial pilot fish and remoras, dolphin, ocean sharks and ocean sunfish. Most of these species migrate back and forth across open oceans, rarely venturing over continental shelves. Some true residents associate with drifting jellyfish or seaweeds.
              Partial residents occur in three groups: species which live in the zone only when they are juveniles (drifting with jellyfish and seaweeds); species which live in the zone only when they are adults (salmon, flying fish, dolphin and whale sharks); and deep water species which make nightly migrations up into the surface waters (such as the lantern fish). </p>
            <p align="justify">Accidental residents occur occasionally when adults and juveniles of species from other environments are carried by accident into the zone by currents. </p></td>

              Epipelagic fish inhabit the epipelagic zone. The&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epipelagic_zone" title="Epipelagic zone">epipelagic zone</a>&nbsp;is the water from the surface of the sea down to 200 metres.

The photic zone is defined as the surface waters down to the point where the sunlight has attenuated to 1 percent of the surface value. This depth depends on how&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbid" title="Turbid">turbid</a>&nbsp;the water is, but in clear water can extend to 200 metres, coinciding with the epipelagic zone.

              <p align="justify">                The epipelagic zone is vast, and is the home for most pelagic fish. The zone is well lit so visual predators can use their eyesight, is usually well mixed and oxygenated from wave action, and can be a good habitat for algae to grow. However, it is an almost featureless habitat. This lack of habitat diversity results in a lack of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_diversity" title="Species diversity">species diversity</a>, so the zone supports less than 2 percent of the world's known fish species. Much of the zone lacks nutrients for supporting fish, so epipelagic fish tend to be found in coastal water above the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_shelves" title="Continental shelves">continental shelves</a>, where&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_runoff" title="Land runoff">land runoff</a>&nbsp;can provide nutrients, or in those parts of the ocean where&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upwelling" title="Upwelling">upwelling</a>&nbsp;moves nutrients into the area.</p>

This can give an effect of transparency. At medium depths at sea, light comes from above, so a mirror oriented vertically makes animals such as fish invisible from the side.</p>
              <p align="justify">                In the shallower epipelagic waters, the mirrors must reflect a mixture of wavelengths, and the fish accordingly has crystal stacks with a range of different spacings. A further complication for fish with bodies that are rounded in cross-section is that the mirrors would be ineffective if laid flat on the skin, as they would fail to reflect horizontally. The overall mirror effect is achieved with many small reflectors, all oriented vertically. </p>
              <p align="justify">                Though the number of species is limited, epipelagic fishes are abundant. What they lack in diversity they make up in numbers.

              Many forage fish are facultative predators that can pick individual&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copepod" title="Copepod">copepods</a>&nbsp;or fish larvae out of the water column, and then change to filter feeding on&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton" title="Phytoplankton">phytoplankton</a>&nbsp;when energetically that gives better results. Filter feeding fish usually use long fine&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gill_raker" title="Gill raker">gill rakers</a>&nbsp;to strain small organisms from the water column.
