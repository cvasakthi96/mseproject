	variety of all life on earth. India is one of the 12-mega diverse
	countries of the world. With only 2.5% of the land area, India already
	accounts for 7.8% of the global recorded species. India is also rich in
	traditional and indigenous knowledge, both coded and informal.</p>

	<p class="style27" align="justify">India is a Party to the

	rights of States to use their own biological resources, the Convention
	expects the parties to facilitate access to genetic resources by other
	Parties subject to national legislation and on mutually agreed upon
	terms (Article 3 and 15 of CBD). Article 8(j) of the Convention on
	Biological Diversity recognizes contributions of local and indigenous
	communities to the conservation and sustainable utilization of
	biological resources through traditional knowledge, practices and
	innovations and provides for equitable sharing of benefits with such
	people arising from the utilization of their knowledge, practices and
	innovations.</p>

	Biological Diversity (or World Biodiversity Day) is an UN-sanctioned
	international holiday for the promotion of biodiversity issues. It is
	currently held on May 22. <br />
	<br />
	Recently, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA), indicated that
	climate change is likely to become the dominant direct driver of
	biodiversity loss by the end of the century. Current climate change
	estimates predict increases in temperatures of 1.4&deg;C to 5.8&deg;C by 2100.
	This will affect species in several ways such as: changes in
	distribution; increased extinction rates; changes in reproduction
	timings; and changes in length of growing seasons for plants</span></p>

	<p>From its creation by the
	Second Committee of the UN General Assembly in 1993 until 2000, it was
	held on December 29 to celebrate the day the Convention on Biological
	Diversity went into effect. In December 2000, the date was shifted to
	commemorate the adoption of the Convention on May 22, 1992 at the Rio
	Earth Summit, and partly to avoid the many other holidays that occur in
	late December. <br />
	<br />
	The rich variety of life on Earth has always had to deal with a
	changing climate. However, the unprecedented pace of change we are
	presently experiencing is so rapid that a great number of species can
	not adapt fast enough to the new conditions, or move to regions more
	suited for their survival due to habitat fragmentation. In fact, recent
	estimates show that up to a million species may become extinct as a
	result of climate change. <br />
	<br />
	On the positive side, biodiversity can help to reduce the
	effects of climate change on the world&rsquo;s population and ecosystems.
	Indeed, the links between biodiversity and climate change run both
	ways: biodiversity is threatened by climate change, but biodiversity
	resources can reduce the impacts of climate change. It is therefore
	crucial to conserve biodiversity that is especially sensitive to
	climate change, preserve habitats so as to facilitate the long-term
	adaptation of biodiversity, improve our understanding of climate change
	and biodiversity linkages, and fully integrate biodiversity
	considerations into mitigation and adaptation improved. This
	constitutes plans. If the threats of biodiversity loss and climate
	change are tackled together, the prospects for adapting successfully to
	the challenges of the coming decades will be very much the overall
	message for this year&rsquo;s celebration of the International Day for
	Biological Diversity. <br />
	<br />
	The National Biodiversity Authority established in 2003 by the
	Government of India to regulate, conserve and sustainable use of
	bioresources of India through the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 lists
	what has been done throughout the years to celebrate the International
	Day for Biological Diversity and informs CBD. Hence you are requested
	to kindly inform National Biodiversity Authority on the activities made
	during the World Biodiversity Day to the Secretary, NBA (<a href="mailto:nba_india@vsnl.net">nba_india@vsnl.net</a>)</p>
