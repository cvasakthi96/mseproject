        <p align="justify" ><strong>Soil and climate</strong><br />
          It is generally suitable for higher  elevation (1500 m and above). It can also be grown in the plains under ideal  condition of fertile loamy soils with salt-free irrigation water. The ideal  climate for rose growing should have temperature with a minimum of 15&deg;C and maximum of 28&deg;C. Light is important factor which  decides the growth. The growth is slowed by day length, i.e. &gt; 12 hours and  heavy overcast, cloudy/mist conditions. High relative humidity exposes the  plant to serious fungal diseases. In tropics the ideal temperature is 25&deg;C &ndash; 30&deg;C on sunny day and on cloudy day 18&deg;C &ndash; 20&deg;C. The optimum temperature should be  15&deg;C &ndash;  18&deg;C. These  temperatures are extremely difficult to find and it&rsquo;s therefore to compromise.</p>
        <p align="justify" ><strong>Propagation and planting</strong> <br />
  The crop can be propagated by rooted cuttings or by  budding on Briar root stocks in hills and on Edward Rose and <em>Rosa indica </em>in plains. One year old  budded plants are planted in July - August at 75cm x 75cm spacing.</p>
        <p align="justify" ><strong>Planting of Rose</strong><br />
            <strong>After cultivation</strong><br />
   The plants should be watered daily until they  establish and thereafter once in a week. Pruning is done during March and  October. Spray Diuran 2.5 kg a.i/ha to control weeds. Avoid spray fluid coming in contact with Rose  plants.</p>

          <strong>Pruning</strong> </p>
        <p align="justify" ><strong>Support of the plants</strong><br />
Post is  placed at internals of 3m on both sides of the bed. Along the sides of the bed,  galvanized wires or plastic string are fastened at the posts at 30cm &ndash; 40cm  intervals to support the plant. Between the wires across the bed, thin strings  can be tied to keep the width of the beds constant.</p>
        <p align="justify" ><strong>Disbudding</strong><br />
          Varieties  produce some side buds below the center bud. These side buds have to be removed  or disbudded. The disbudding must be done regularly and also as soon as  possible in order to avoid large wounds in the upper leaf axil.</p>

        <p align="justify" ><strong>Dead shoot removal</strong><br />
        In the old plants the dead shoot or dried shoots on  plants will serve as the host for fungi. So regularly these have to be removed.</p>
        <p align="justify" ><strong>Soil loosening on beds</strong><br />
          After 6 months or so, there is every chance that the soil  become stony and it has to be loosened for efficient irrigation.</p>
        <p align="justify" ><strong>Bending</strong><br />
          Leaf is a source of food for every plant. There should be  balance between Source (Assimilation) and sink (Dissimilation). After planting, 2 to 3 eye buds will sprout  on main branch. These sprouts will grow as branches and these branches in turn  form buds. The mother shoot is bend on 2nd leaf or nearer to the  crown region. The first bottom break or ground shoot will start coming from the  base. These ground shoots form the basic framework for production and thereon  the ground shoots should be cut at 5th five pair of leaves and  medium ground shoots should be cut at 2nd or 3rd five  pair of leaves.</p>

        <p align="justify" ><strong>Defoliation</strong><br />
          The removal of leaves is known as defoliation. It is done  mainly to induce certain plant species to flower or to reduce transpiration  loss during periods of stress. Defoliation may be done by removal of leaves  manually or by withholding water. The shoots are defoliated after pruning<strong>. </strong> </p>
        <p align="justify" ><strong>Manuring</strong><br />
  At three months interval, apply FYM at 10 kg and 8:8:16 g  NPK/plant after each pruning. For cv.Happiness NPK may be applied @  75:150:50 g/plant/year.</p>
        <p align="justify" ><strong>Harvest</strong><br />
          Harvesting is done with  sharp secateure at the tight bud stage when the colour is fully developed and the petals  have not yet started unfolding.  There should be 1-2 mature leaves (those with five leaflets) left on the plant  after the flower has been cut. The reason for leaving these matures leaves is  to encourage production of new strong shoots. Harvesting is done preferably  during early morning hours.</p>

        <p align="justify" ><strong>Postharvest  handling</strong><br />
          Roses must be placed in a bucket of water inside the  polyhouse immediately after harvesting and transported to cold storage (2-4&deg;C).  The length of time depends upon the variety and quality of the roses.The  flowers are graded according to the length. It varies from 40-70 cm depending  on the variety and packed in 10/12 per bunch.</p>

        <p align="justify" ><strong>Physiological  disorders</strong><br />
            <strong>Blind wood</strong><br />
          The normal flowering shoot on a greenhouse rose possesses  fully expanded sepals, petals, and reproductive parts. The failure to develop a  flower on the apical end of the stem is a common occurrence. Such shoots are  termed as blind wood. The sepals and petals are present, but the reproductive  parts are absent or aborted. Blind wood is generally short and thin, but it may  attain considerable length and thickness when it develops at the top of the  plant. This may be caused by low temperature, insufficient light, chemical  residues, insect, pests, fungal diseases and other factors.</p>
        <p align="justify" ><strong>Bull heads or malformed flowers</strong><br />
          The center petals of the bud remain only partly developed  and the bud appears flat. They are common on very vigorous shoots, particularly  bottom breaks, and it is possible that there is a lack of carbohydrates to  develop the petals. The cause of bull heading is yet unknown, however, thrips  infestation will also cause malformed flowers. Also at low temperature, some  varieties will form bull heads.</p>
        <p align="justify" ><strong>Colour fading</strong><br />
          The off- coloured flowers are seem to be a problem with  some yellow varieties. In these varieties the petals may be green or a dirty  white instead of a clear yellow. Raising the night temperature several degrees  will reduce the number of off-coloured flowers. Occasionally the pink or red  varieties develop bluish-coloured flowers. This is very often associated with  use of organic phosphate and various other kinds of insecticides.</p>
        <p align="justify" ><strong>Limp necks</strong><br />
   The area of the stem just  below the flower &ldquo;wilts&rdquo; and will not support the head. This may be due to  insufficient water absorption; cutting off the lower 1 to 2 inches of stem and  placing the cut stem in water at 37&deg;C will revive the flower. </p>
        <p align="justify" ><strong>Blackening of rose petals</strong><br />
          This is caused by low temperature and high anthocyanin  content. GA3 treatment causes accumulation of anthocyanin in petals  of Baccara roses. This effect was more pronounced at low temperature (20&deg;C at  day and 4&deg;C at night) than in higher temperature (30&deg;C at day and 20&deg;C at  night).</p>
        <p align="justify" ><strong>Nutritional disorders</strong><br />
          Iron deficiencies can cause pale foliage. Adjusting the  pH of the soil may solve this problem.</p>
        <p align="justify" ><strong>Yield</strong> <br />
  The Hybrid Teas roses can yield about 70 &ndash; 80 stems/plant/year,  while the Floribundas yield yields 80 -90 stems/plant/year.</p>
