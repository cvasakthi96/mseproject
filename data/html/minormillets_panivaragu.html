            <p>Proso millet is important minor millet grown  in India. The crop is able to evade drought by its quick maturity. Being a  short duration crop (60 -90 days) with relatively low water requirement, this  escapes drought period and, therefore, offers better prospects for intensive  cultivation in dry land areas. Under unirrigated conditions, proso millet is  generally grown during kharif season but in areas where irrigation facilities  are available, this is profitably grown as summer catch crop in high intensity  rotations.</p>
            <p><strong>Origin  and History</strong>: Proso  millet probably originated in India. It spread from India to other cheena  growing parts of the world. It might have originated for <em>Panicum psilopodium</em> which is found in its wild state in Burma,  India and Malaysia.</p>
            <p><strong>Area  and Distribution</strong>:Proso  millet is one of the oldest grain crops and is grown in many parts of the world  known by different names such as broom corn millet, hog millet, Hershey millet,  proso millet or common millet, etc. It is grown extensively in India, Japan,  China, Egypt, Arabia and Western Europe.In  India proso millet is largely grown in Madhya Pradesh, eastern Uttar Pradesh,  Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.</p>
            <p><strong>Botanical  Description</strong>: It  is an erect herbaceous annual which tillers profusely. Its plant grows up to a height  of 45-100 centimetre. Stem is slender with distinctly swollen nodes. The roots  are fibrous and shallow. The leaves are linear, slender and the leaf sheath  encloses the entire internode. The inflorescence is a much branched panicle  without bristles having spikelets at the tips if the branches. Usually the last  or the fourth glume encloses a perfect flower which sets grain. The glume and  palea are firmly attached to the grain. The seeds may be creamy white, yellow,  red or black.</p>

              <p><strong>CROP  MANAGEMENT</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Climatic  Requirements: </strong>Proso millet is  a crop of warm climate. It is grown extensively in warm regions of the world.  It is highly drought resistant and can be grown in areas where there is scanty  rainfall. It can withstand water stagnation also to some extent. It is a hardly  crop which completes its life cycle in a short span of time.</p>
              <p><strong>Soil</strong>: Proso  millet can be grown both in rich and poor soils, having variable texture,  ranging between sandy loam to clays of black cotton soils, Coarse sands are not  suited for proso millet cultivation. Well drained loam or sandy loam soils free  from <em>Kankar</em> and rise in organic  matter are ideal for proso millet cultivation. </p>
              <p><strong>Field  Preparation</strong>: Soon  after harvesting of the previous crop, the field should be ploughed to expose  the soil to sun and enable it to retain more moisture. With the onset of  monsoon, the land should be harrowed two or three times and then finally  leveled. When it is being grown during summer, one irrigation should be given  prior to land preparations. As soon as the soil comes in the working conditions,  the seedbed should be prepared by running harrow or desi plough thrice followed  by planking. Proso millet needs a firm and clean seedbed but does not respond  to deep ploughing.</p>
              <p><strong>Seed  and Sowing</strong>:The  importance of healthy and disease free seed hardly needs to be emphasized. Proso  millet is no exception. It is desirable that the seed be treated with  organo-mercurial compounds like Agrosan G.N. or Ceresan at the rate of 2.5g per  Kg of seed before sowing.<br>  
                <strong>1).  Time of Sowing</strong>: As  a kharif crop, proso millet should be sown in the first fortnight of July with  the onset of monsoon rains and as a summer crop it should be sown by the middle  of April. During summer, it would be desirable to sow proso millet as soon as  the harvesting of the Rabi crop is over.</p>
              <p><strong>2).  Seed Rate and Method of Sowing</strong>: Prosomillet  can be sown by broadcasting or drilling seeds in furrows 3-4 centimetre deep.  Row to row distance should be kept 25 centimetre and plant to plant 10 centimetre.  Line sowing ensures better germination, cuts down seed requirement and  facilitates intercultural operations compare to broadcast sowing. Depending  upon the method of sowing, 8-12 kg seed is required for sowing one hectare of  land.</p>
              <p><strong>Manures  and Fertilisers</strong>: Proso  millet being a short duration crop, requires relatively less amount of  nutrients compared to other cereals. To get a good crop, general fertilizer  recommendations under irrigated condition are 40-60 kg nitrogen, 30 kg P2O5  and 20 kg K2O per hectare. Apply half of the nitrogen and whole  amount of phosphorus and potash as a basal dose at the time of sowing. The  remaining half of nitrogen should be applied at the time of the first  irrigation. Under rainfed condition, fertilizer dose is reduced to half of the  irrigated crop. If  organic manure is available, it may be added to the soil about a month before  sowing at the rate of 4 to 10 tonnes per hectare.</p>
              <p><strong>Water  Management: </strong>Proso  millet sown during Kharif season, generally does not require any irrigation.  However, at tillering stage, if dry spell prevails for longer period, then one  irrigation must be given to boost yields. Summer crop, however, would require  two to four irrigations depending upon soil type and climatic conditions. Give  first irrigation 25-30 days after sowing and second irrigation about 40-45 days  after sowing. Due to shallow root system of proso millet, heavy irrigation is  not advisable.</p>
              <p>                <strong>Weed  Control</strong>: For  getting high yield and minimising loss of soil moisture and nutrients, the  field should be kept weed-free up to 35 days stage. Two weedings at an interval  of 15-20 days would help control it. Weedings may be done with hand hoe or  wheel hoe.</p>
              <p><strong>Disease</strong>: Head  smut (<em>Sphacelorheca destruens</em>) is a  common disease of proso millet. The affected panicles become elongated and  thickened. The smut masses rupture before harvest. This is a seed-borne disease  and can be controlled by treating seeds with organo-mercurial compounds like  Ceresan at the rate of 3g per kg of seed or hot water treatment (soaking seeds  in hot water at 550C for 7-12 minutes). Sometimes  bacterial streak is also noticed. It can be controlled by the seed treatment  with 5% magnesium arsenate at the rate of one gm of the chemical in one kg of  seed.<br>  

                <strong>Insect  Pests</strong>: Among  insects, shootfly is important for this crop. This insect damages the crop in  the seedling stage. Apply 15 kg of Thimet granules per hectare in the soil at  the time of field preparation. </p>
              <p><strong>Harvesting  and Threshing</strong>: Proso  millet is ready for harvest after 65-75 days of sowing in most of the  varieties. Harvest the crop when it is about to mature. The seeds in the tip of  upper heads ripe and shatter before the lower seeds and later panicles get  mature. Therefore, the crop should be harvested when about two thirds of seeds  are ripe. Crop is threshed with hand or bullocks.</p>
              <p><strong>Yield</strong>: With  improved package of practices it is possible to harvest 20-23 quintals of grain  and 50-60 quintals of straw per hectare.<br>
