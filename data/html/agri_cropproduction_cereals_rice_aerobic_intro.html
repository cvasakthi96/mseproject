          Aerobic rice can be found, or can be a suitable&nbsp;technology, in the following areas:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="class-success"><p align="justify">&ldquo;Favorable uplands&rdquo;: these are areas where the land is flat, and where rainfall with or without supplemental&nbsp;irrigation is sufficient to frequently bring the soil&nbsp;water content close to field capacity, and where farmers have access to external inputs such as&nbsp;fertilizers.</li>
            <li class="class-success"><p align="justify">Fields on upper slopes or terraces in undulating,&nbsp;rainfed lowlands: quite often, soils in these areas&nbsp;are relatively coarse-textured and well-drained,&nbsp;so that ponding of water occurs only briefly or not&nbsp;at all during the growing season.</li>
            <li class="class-success">Water-short irrigated lowlands: these are areas where&nbsp;farmers do not have access to sufficient water&nbsp;anymore to keep rice fields flooded for a&nbsp;substantial period of time.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="style22"><strong>Varieties</strong></p>
          <p class="class-success">Suitable variety PMK (R) 3</p>
          <p class="style22"><strong>Spacing</strong></p>
          <p class="class-success">Optimum plant population: 50 hills per m2 (20 x 10 cm)</p>
          <p class="style22"><strong>Land preparation</strong></p>
          <p class="class-success" align="justify">The usual establishment method is dry direct seeding. Aerobic rice also allows practices of conservation agriculture as used in upland crops, such as mulching and minimum tillage. Ridges and furrows were suitable for Aerobic rice.
