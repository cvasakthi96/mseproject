        2) Places emphasis on the use of multiple indigenous trees  and shrubs;<br />
        3) Particularly suitable for low-input conditions and  fragile environments;<br />
        4) It involves the interplay of socio-cultural values more  than in most other land-use systems; and <br />
        5) It is structurally and functionally more complex than  monoculture.</td>

        <p align="left" class="style56">1) Agroforestry is any sustainable land-use system that  maintains or increases total yields by combining food crops (annuals) with tree  crops (perennials) and/or livestock on the same unit of land, either  alternately or at the same time, using management practices that suit the  social and cultural characteristics of the local people and the economic and  eco&shy;logical conditions of the area. </p>
        <p align="left" class="style56">2) Agroforestry is a collective  name for a land-use system and technology whereby woody perennials are  deliberately used on the same land management unit as agricultural crops and/or  animals in some form of spatial arrangement or temporal sequence. In an  agroforestry system there are both ecological and economical interactions  between the various components.</p></td>

        <p>Social forestry is defined as &ldquo;Forestry outside the conventional forests which primarily aim at providing continuous flow of goods and services for the benefit of people. This definition implies that the production of forest goods for the needs of the local people is Social forestry. Thus, social forestry aims at growing forests of the choice of the local population. <br />
      Shah (1985) stated that Conceptually Social forestry deals with poor people to produce goods such as fuel, fodder etc. to meet the needs of the local community particularly underprivileged section. </p></td>

Farm  forestry was defined by NCA (1976) as the practice of forestry in all its  aspects in and the around the farms or village lands integrated with other farm  operations. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>2) Extension&nbsp; Forestry: </strong>&nbsp;It is the practice of forestry in areas devoid  of tree growth and other vegetation situated in places away from the  conventional forest areas with the object of increasing the area under tree growth. <br />
          It includes the following.</span><br />
  <span class="style33"><strong>a)&nbsp; Mixed forestry </strong> <br />
    It is the practice of forestry  for raising fodder grass with scattered fodder trees, fruit trees and fuel wood  trees on suitable wastelands, panchayat lands and village commons<br />
  <strong>b)&nbsp; Shelterbelts</strong><br />
    Shelterbelt is defined as a belt  of trees and or shrubs maintained for the purpose of shelter from wind, sun,  snow drift, etc. <br />
  <strong>c)&nbsp; Linear Strip plantations</strong><br />
    These are the plantations of  fast growing species on linear strips of land.</span></p>

        <strong>4) Recreation Forestry:</strong> It is the practice of  forestry with the object of raising flowering trees and shrubs mainly to serve  as recreation forests for the urban and rural population. This type of forestry  is also known as <strong>Aesthetic forestry </strong>which  is defined as the practice of forestry with the object of developing or  maintaining a forest of high scenic value.</span></p></td>

          The term commercial is used whenever  the scale of the production of the output is the&nbsp; major aim of the system.<br />
  &nbsp; <strong>Examples:<br />
    a)</strong> Commercial production of plantation crops such as rubber,  oilpalm, and coconut&nbsp; with permanent underplanting of&nbsp;  food  crops, pastures<br />
  <strong>b) </strong>Commercial  production shade tolerating plantation crops such as coffee, tea and cocoa under overstorey of shade  trees</p>
        <p align="left" class="style56"><strong>B) Intermediate AF systems: </strong><br />
          Intermediate systems are  those between commercial and subsistence scale of production and management.<br />
  <strong>&nbsp;Examples: <br />
  </strong>Production of  perennial cash crops and subsistence food crops undertaken on farms wherein the cash crops fulfill the cash&nbsp; needs and the food crops meet the family&lsquo;s  food needs.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>C) Subsistence AF systems:</strong><br />
        Subsistence  AF systems are those wherein the use of land is directed towards satisfying  basic needs and is managed mostly by the owner and his family</p></td>
