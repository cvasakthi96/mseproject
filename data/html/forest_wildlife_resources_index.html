Water, wilderness and wildlife are intimately and  irrevocably linked. Wilderness areas and particularly forests which are the  repository of wildlife and biodiversity have either shrunk or disappeared due  to severe agricultural, natural and domestic pressures. Natural processes,  forests and other wildlife habitat recharge aquifiers maintain water regime and  moderate impacts of floods, droughts and cyclones and thereby they ensure food  security and regulate climate change. They are also source of food, fodder,  fuel and other products supplementing the sustenance of local communities.  Conservation of biodiversity is directly linked with conservation of  eco-systems and thus ensure water and food security. The ecological security of  the State as a whole and economic well being of the people nearby through water  and food security can only be achieved by conserving our biodiversity in  perpetuity without any reservation.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="style38">Forests and the  wilderness areas in Tamil Nadu are the treasure-house for multitude of  biodiversity beyond our imagination. They are also the repository and virtual  pharmaceutical factories of an array of medicinal plants. These areas forms the  best underground water tank holding volumes of precious pure water which are  released gradually into the streams, rivers and wells down below. They form the  carbon sink, sucking and storing the lethal carbon-di-oxide for the benefit of  all living things. They are the most natural lungs providing the vital oxygen  for all the living things to breathe and survive.</p>

People&rsquo;s involvement and support is  absolutely essential to make the wildlife conservation a success in our State.  Let us understand the need to conserve our natural heritage and make all people  conscious to conserve and sustainably manage them for the benefit of present  and future well being of the mankind. Man-animal conflict due to clash of  interest is taking a serious and mammoth proportion in and around our protected  areas and needs special attention and care of all concerned.</p>
