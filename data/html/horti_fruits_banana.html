                <td height="163" valign="top"  scope="row">Banana is the fruit of a  plant of the genus<em>Musa</em>(family Musaceae), which is cultivated  primarily for food and secondarily for the production of fibre used in the  textile industry are also cultivated for ornamental purposes. Almost all the  modern edible parthenocarpic bananas come from the two wild species &ndash;<em>Musa  acuminata</em><em>Musa balbisiana</em>. The scientific names of  bananas are<em>Musa acuminata</em>,<em>Musa balbisiana</em>or  hybrids of<em> Musa acuminata and balbisiana,</em>depending on their genomic  constitution.Bananas are vigorously growing, monocotyledonous herbaceous  plants.The banana is not a tree but a high herb that can attain up to 15  meters of height. The cultivars vary  greatly in plant an d fruit size, plant morphology, fruit quality and disease  and insect resistance. Most bananas have a sweet flavor when ripe; exceptions  to this are cooking bananas and plantains. Plantains are hybrid bananas in  which the male flowering axis is either degenerated, lacking, or possess  relicts of male flowers. Plantains are always cooked before consumption and are  higher in starch than bananas. The two groups of plantains, French and Horn,  produce fewer fruit per plant than sweet bananas. The groups differ in whether  the male parts of the inflorescence are present or absent.</td>
