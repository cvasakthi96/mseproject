        <p align="justify" ><strong>Papain extraction</strong><br />
          Papain has  several industrial uses, the important one being in brewing industries. It is  used as &ldquo;meat tenderiser&rdquo; and in textile and leather &ldquo;sanforization&rdquo; processes  and drugs.</p>
        <p align="justify" > The method of  extraction of papain from papaya fruits is simple. The latex should be tapped  from immature papaya fruits. Select 75 to 90 days old fruits. On the selected fruit, give incisions (cut)  with a razor blade or stainless steel knife. The cuts should be given from  stalk to tip of the fruit. The depth of the cut should not be more than 0.3  cm. Four such cuts are given spaced  equally on the fruit surface. Tap the latex early in the morning and complete  the tapping before 10.00 a.m. Repeat the  tapping four times on the same fruit at an interval of three days. The cut  should be given on the fruit surface in places not covered by previous cuts.  The latex collected from all the trees in a day should be pooled, shade dried  in an aluminium pan or tray and passed through a 50 mesh sieve to remove all  foreign matter. In large plantations, vacuum driers can be adopted with  advantage. Papain produced by artificial heating will have better colour and  high quality. Add potassium meta-bi-sulphite (KMS) at 0.5 % for better colour  and keeping quality.</p>
        <p align="justify" > The latex  should be dried very rapidly at temperatures of 50&deg;  to 55&deg; C. Stop drying when the dried product comes off  as flakes having a porous texture.  Powder the dried papain by means of wooden mallets or in electrically  operated granulators and sieve the powder through 10 mesh sieve. Pack the  powder in polythene bags in convenient quantities and seal them. Put the sealed  bags in a tin container and seal it after evacuating air. Exposure to air deteriorates  the quality of papain and vacuum sealing is therefore necessary. For large  scale manufacture of papain, vacuum sealing machine and a granulator will be  useful. </p>
        <p align="justify" > The green  papaya fruits after extraction of papain can be used for pectin manufacture and  &ldquo;tutty &ndash; fruity&rdquo; or they can be allowed to ripen and made into other products.  The Co.2 and Co.5 varieties of papaya released by Tamil  Nadu Agricultural  University, Coimbatore are ideal for papain production. Tamil Nadu Agricultural University,  Coimbatore,  supplies pure seeds of these varieties.</p>
        <p align="justify" ><strong>Yield</strong><br />
           The yield of crude papain is as  follows:<br />
           CO 2  : 600 kg/ha<br />
       CO 5  : 800 Kg/ha</p>
        <p ><strong>Seed Technology</strong><br />
          <strong>Germination improvement:</strong> Store the seeds in  airtight containers. Soak the seeds in 100ppm GA3 for16 hours or in  2% fresh leaf extract of arappu or 1% pungam leaf extract or pellet the seeds with  arappu leaf powder.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Optimum depth of sowing:</strong> Sow seeds at 1cm depth for  better germination and seedling growth.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Grading: </strong>BSS6 wiremesh sieve.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Storage:</strong> Dry seeds to 8-10% moisture  and treat with halogen mixture containing CaOCl2, CaCO3 and arappu leaf powder (at  5:4:1 ratio)@3g/kg and pack in cloth bag to maintain viability upto 5 months.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Invigoration of old seeds</strong><br />
      Stored  seeds can be invigorated by soaking them in dilute solution of disodium phosphate  (10-4 M) adopting 1:8 seed to solution ratio for 4 hours followed by drying back  to original moisture content.</p></td>
