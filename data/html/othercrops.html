<p   >The genus <em>Nicotiana</em> includes more than 60 species,  of which <em>N. tabacum</em> and <em>N. rustica</em> are the two commonly  
cultivated for producing commercial tobacco. <em>N. tabacum</em> is widely cultivated in most countries of the world  while <em>N. rustica</em> is restricted to India, 
 Russia and few other Asiatic countries. The primary centre of origin of <em>N. tabacum</em> is South America and that of <em>N. rustica</em> peru.<br />
<strong>Area and  production</strong><br />
In India tobacco is  predominantly cultivated in AP, Gujarat, Karnataka, UP and Bihar. Gujarat  accounts for 45 per cent of the area (0.13 M ha) and 30 per cent of production 
(0.16 M t). Productivity is also highest (1700 kg ha-1) in Gujarat  followed by AP.<br />
<strong>Types of  tobacco</strong><br />
Anand area of Gujarat grows  wholly bidi tobacco. Nipani area of Karnataka grows bidi tobacco.
North Bihar  and Bengal area has both tabacum and rustica types used in the manufacture of  hookah and to a limited extent chewing and snuff types.
Madurai and Coimbatore  area of Tamil Nadu grow cigar, filter, binder and chewing tobaccos.<br />
<strong>Climate  and soil</strong><br />
In India, tobacco is grown  when the mean temperature is 20&deg; to 27&deg;C. When grown as rainfed crop, it  requires at least about 500 mm of well distributed rainfall 
during crop growing  season. It is not usually grown where rainfall exceeds 1200 mm during the  season. Rainfall is undesirable during crop maturity, as gums and resins 
on the  leaf get washed. In India, all types of tobaccos except cigar, filter and  binder tobaccos and chewing tobacco of south India receive very little rain  during growing season.<br />
In India, cigar and binder  tobaccos are grown on sandy to loamy red soils of Coimbatore, Tiruchirapalli  and Madurai districts of Tamil Nadu. It needs larger quantities 
of nitrogen,  potassium, calcium and magnesium. Light to medium loams of old alluvium origin  are best suited to bidi tobacco. In Tamil Nadu chewing tobacco is grown on
 well  drained red soils of Coimbatore,&nbsp; Tanjore,  Salem and Madurai districts.<br />

<p   >Tobacco seeds are very  small and egg-shaped with thick seed- coat. They are about 0.75 mm long, 0.53  mm broad and 0.47 mm thick.
 Depending on the variety and the conditions under  which the seed is produced, the size and the weight of the seed vary  considerably. 
In N. tabacum the average weight of the seed is 0.08 to 0.09 mg  and there are 11,000 - 12,000 seeds per gram. In N. rustica, the seed is larger  and about three times heavier. 
The emerging seedlings are tiny and delicate and  therefore, the seeds are unsuitable for sowing directly in the field.
 Hence  they are sown in small areas called nurseries or seed beds and tended carefully  till the seedlings attain a particular size before transplanting in the main  field. 
For successful raising of nurseries proper location, good preparation  and manuring, adequate facilities for watering and timely controlling of pests  and diseases are essential.<br />
<br />
Generally tobacco nurseries are grown on sandy or sandy loam soil. The  cigarette-tobacco growing areas of Andhra Pradesh are an exception in that the 
crop is grown on a heavy black soil and the nurseries are generally raised on  sandy to gravely loams. Raising of nurseries on heavy black soils is hazardous 
due to poor internal drainage caused by high clay content coupled with  prevalence of heavy rainfall and high temperatures, pre-disposing the crop for  disease like damping off.<br />
<br />
The nursery site should  have a good internal as well as surface drainage and should be situated at an  elevated place. Growing of a green manure crop like dhaincha or 
sunnhemp for 6  to 7 weeks and ploughing it is also practiced in places like Dinhata (West Bengal).<br />
It is desirable to change the nursery site every year as it would minimise  incidence of pests and diseases and also eliminate contamination by other  varieties. If it is not possible to change the site, old site can be used after  sterilizing by rabbing, i.e. by burning any readily available slow-burning  waste-materials like, tobacco-stalks, paddy-husk, sugarcane-trash, etc. For the  best results this operation should be done at the right moisture content, after  the final preparation of the bed and a few days before sowing. <br />
<strong>Tillage </strong><br />
In general, preparatory  tillage is almost common for all tobaccos. However, the number of ploughings  varies from soil to soil depending on soil physical properties.
There is also  practice of digging the field with cow bars soon after the harvest of preceding  crop. During the active monsoon period, hand removal of weeds is resorted
to  for keeping the field weed free since ploughing of heavy soils is  impracticable.<br />

<p   > Topping is removal of  terminal bud with or without some of the op leaves just before or after the  emergence of the flower head.</p>

<p   > After topping, the  auxillary buds grow and put forth shoots known as suckers. Removal of these  suckers is called desuckering or suckering.<br />
The objective of topping  and desuckering is to divert the energy and nutrients from flowers to the  leaves for increasing their size and final leaf yield beside improvement
 in  quality. Most of the tobaccos grown are topped and suckered, except wrapper tobacco  where texture is important.<br />

<p   ><strong>Seasons </strong><br />
Optimum time of sowing  nurseries and transplanting varies from place to place and for different types  and varieties even in the same place. Generally, 
nurseries are raised from  April to May and transplanted upto October.<br />

<p   >  Weed problems in tobacco  are acute both in the seedbed and in the transplanted crop. Orobanche is also a  predominant parasitic weed in tobacco<strong>.</strong></p>
<p   ><strong>Nurseries </strong><br />
Most common method of  weeding in tobacco nurseries in tropical and subtropical countries is hand  pulling. In developed countries, however, chemicals are used for effective
 weed  control. Some of the temporary soil sterilants used in tobacco nurseries are<br />
Methylbromide  (8-10 kg 100-3)<br />
Metham  (2-5 kg 100-3)<br />
Calcium  cyanamide (50-60 kg 100-3) <br />
<strong>Transplanted  field</strong><br />
Critical  period of weed competition in the planted crop is the first 60 days after  transplantation. In a transplanted crop, inter-row cultivation is feasible due  to wider row spacing.
Hence, one or two cultivations followed by manual weeding  give adequate control of weeds. As tobacco is sensitive to most POST  herbicides. PPI herbicides provide effective weed control.
Herbicides commonly  recommended before planting the seedlings in the main field are<br />
Pronamide  (1.5-2)<br />
Fluchloralin  (2-3)<br />
Isopropalin  (1.5-2)<br />
        Isoxaben  (1.5-2.5)</p>
<p   >Against <em>Orobanche cernua</em> (broomrape) in  particular, fumigating with DMTT granules at 300-500 kg ha-1 about  30-40 days before transplanting tobacco seedling
 is effective.<br />
<strong>Harvesting </strong><br />
The signs of maturity and  the method of harvest differ with the type of tobacco. Essentially, there are  two methods of harvest: priming and stalk cut method.<br />
<strong>Priming </strong><br />
In tobacco, generally,  lower leaves mature first followed by upper leaves in regular ascending order.  Harvesting is done by removing a few leaves as and when they mature.
 This  method of harvesting is known as priming. Cigarette and wrapper tobaccos are  harvested by priming.<br />
<strong>Stalk  cut method</strong><br />
Cigar, cheroot, chewing,  bidi and hookah tobaccos are harvested by stalk cut method. In this method,  plants are cut close to the ground with a sickle and generally
 left in the  field overnight for wilting. Subsequent handling varies with the method of  curing. The correct stage of harvest is when maximum number of leaves mature.</p>

<p   ><strong></strong> Curing is a slow process of  starvation phenomenon to produce dried leaf of suitable physical and chemical  property attained by various regimes of 
ventilation, temperature and humidity  control. At the completion of curing process, even though the leaf is dead in  the biological sense, some active enzymes may be present. 
The freshly harvested  leaf may be grouped into three  components, which are likely to change upon curing. The static group, dynamic  group and nitrogen group are the three classes.<br />
The static group is less  variable and consists of crude fibre, cellulose, hemicellulose, pectins,  tannins etc. in the nitrogen group, some changes takes place. The components 
 include proteins, soluble nitrogen including ammonia, nitrates, amides and  alkaloids. Major changes take place in the dynamic group, which 
is made up of  sugars, starches and organic acids.<br />
