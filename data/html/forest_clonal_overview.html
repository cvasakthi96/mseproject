        <p align="justify" class="style47">Clonal  selection and deployment is receiving attention as an intensive forest  management tool for increased wood production. Many pulp, paper and other wood  based industries are now establishing clonal forestry programme after the  promulgation of 1988 National Forest Policy. The new policy under para 4.9 has  given clear indication that the forest based industries must prefer to raise  required raw materials by themselves. The industries should establish direct  relationship with individual growers of raw material by providing them credit,  technical advice, harvesting and transport services. The policy also indicated  that small and marginal farmers have to be encouraged to grow wood species  required in forest based industries in their marginal and submarginal lands.  This has created excellent scope for establishing plantations of industrial  importance using clonal propagation. Many wood based industries in particular,  pulp and paper industries are involved in plantation establishment programme  using clonal forestry approaches in the recent past. However, there is no  systematic approach for clonal forestry establishment and also there is growing  interest to develop in future industrial wood plantations through clonal  forestry approaches. The need to all stakeholders is a readymade reference  material incorporating the strategies, methods, and experiences of stakeholders  in the area of clonal forestry.</p>

        <p align="left" class="style41">a) Production of quality planting stock</p>
        <p align="justify" class="style12">In the intensive management of forests it is very  important of develop fast and economical methods of raising superior planting  stock. The somatic propagation of trees has an edge over raising of stock  through seeds. These techniques have also become important in forestry owing to  their potential in propagating trees, which possess superior traits, in an  effort to increase volume and quality of production.</p>
        <div align="justify" class="style41">b) Propagation of problem trees</div>
        <p align="justify" class="style12">There are many tree species, which normally produce  little or no viable seeds, and some tree seeds have poor germination capacity.  Such trees can easily be propagated vegetatively. Propagation by vegetative  means is easy, more rapid and economical than by seed. In some tree species,  germination is very poor or slow or there may exist complex dormancy problems  or the seed may lose its viability very quickly. Moreover, seedlings of many  species grow slowly and take a long time to reach marketable size. In all  these cases, use of vegetative multiplication is a more convenient method of  propagation.</p>

        <div align="justify" class="style41">c) Maintenance of genetic uniformity</div>
        <p align="justify" class="style12">Most of the tree species are cross-pollinated and  naturally they are highly heterozygous. The progenies of such cross-pollinated  trees are not true to type and loose many of their unique characteristics.  Hence, asexual clonal propagation helps in maintaining the genetic  characteristics of each species.</p>
        <div align="justify" class="style41">d) Production of disease free plants</div>
        <p align="justify" class="style12">Certain tree species are often susceptible to some  pests and diseases and others may be partially or entirely resistant.  Vegetative approaches using grafting will help to produce resistant clones.</p>
        <div align="justify" class="style41">e) Early flower induction</div>
        <p align="justify" class="style12">Vegetatively propagated plants are precocious in  bearing i.e. Flower earlier than seed propagated plants. This will help to  reduce the rotation of the tree species and also to increase the productivity.  This will ultimately help to speed up the reproductive cycle for accelerated  breeding and testing.</p>
        <div align="justify" class="style41">f) Clonal repository</div>
        <p align="justify" class="style12">Vegetative propagation helps to preserve the  genotypes in clonal banks. This will also help to evaluate genotypes and their  interaction with the environment through clonal testing. This method of  propagation will help to conserve and multiply the valuable trees in a  centralized area such as in a laboratory or green house for intensive study and  breeding.</p>
        <div align="justify" class="style41">g) Maintenance of genetic gain</div>
        <p align="justify" class="style12">Vegetative propagation ultimately helps to capture  maximum genetic gains when used for regeneration in operational planting programme.</p>

        <p align="justify" class="style12">Clonal  propagation in many forestry tree species is more expensive than seed  propagation. It is a specialist&rsquo;s job and requires special training and  knowledge on the part of the propagator.<br />
          Vegetatively  propagated plants are comparatively short lived. Lack of tap root system in  vegetatively propagated trees results in poor anchorage in the soil;  consequently such trees are easily uprooted during heavy winds or storms.</p>

        <p align="justify" class="style12">The  clonal multiplication reproduces clones, which contain all the genetic  information of the parent tree. The term clone is used to mean a genetically  uniform plant material derived from a single individual and propagated  exclusively by vegetative means. Before going for clonal propagation, the first  step is selection of genetically superior tree or elite tree or mother tree.  The selection guidelines for various tree species are discussed in chapter II.  After selecting the trees, the clonal materials are collected and used for  propagation. The cultural requirements of all the individual members of a clone  are under a particular site of environment conditions. Environment can modify  the growth and development of individual members of a clone. Clones are less broadly  adopted. Eventhough each members of a clone has the same genotypes, the  individual genotypes can possess a considerable ability for adoption to  differing adverse environments. It is possible to select clones that posses  greater adoptability than that possessed by the seedling. A forest tree needs  great adaptability mainly to survive and to reproduce.</p>
