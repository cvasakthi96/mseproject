        <p align="justify" class="style38"> The incidence of forest fires in the country is on the  increase and more area is burned each year. The major cause of this failure is  the piecemeal approach to the problem. Both the national focus and the  technical resources required for sustaining a systematic forest fire management  programme are lacking in the country. Important forest fire management elements  like strategic fire centres, coordination among Ministries, funding, human  resource development, fire research, fire management, and extension programmes  are missing.<br />
            <br />
          Taking into consideration the serious nature of the problem, it is necessary to  make some major improvements in the forest fire management strategy for the  country. The Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India, has  prepared a National Master Plan for Forest Fire Control. This plan proposes to  introduce a well-coordinated and integrated fire-management programme that  includes the following components: </p>
