        <p align="justify"><strong>Composting - an overview </strong></p>
        <p align="justify">Composting  is the natural process of 'rotting' or decomposition of organic matter by  microorganisms under controlled conditions. Raw organic materials such as crop  residues, animal wastes, food garbage, some municipal wastes and suitable  industrial wastes, enhance their suitability for application to the soil as a  fertilizing resource, after having undergone composting.</p>
        <p align="justify">A mass of rotted organic matter made from waste is called compost. The compost made from farm waste like sugarcane trash, paddy straw, weeds and other plants and other waste is called farm compost. The average nutrient contents of farm compost are 0.5 per cent N, 0.15 per cent P2O5and 0.5 per cent K2O<em>.&nbsp;</em>The nutrient value of farm compost can be increased by application of superphosphate or rock phosphate at 10 to 15 kg/t of raw material at the initial stage of filling the compost pit. The compost made from town refuses like night soil, street sweepings and dustbin refuse is called town compost. It contains 1.4 per cent N, 1.00 per cent P2O5 and 1.4 per cent K2O.</p>
        <p align="justify">Farm compost is made by placing farm wastes in trenches of suitable size, say, 4.5 m to 5.0 m long, 1.5m to 2.0 m wide and 1.0 m to 2.0 m deep. Farm waste is placed in the trenches layer by layer. Each layer is well moistened by sprinkling cow dung slurry or water. Trenches are filled up to a height of 0.5 m above the ground. The compost is ready for application within five to six months.</p>
        <p align="justify">Composting is essentially a microbiological decomposition of organic residues collected from rural area (rural compost) or urban area (urban compost).</p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Methods of composting</strong></p>
        <p align="justify">In&nbsp;<strong>Coimbatore method</strong>, composting is done in pits of different sizes depending on the waste material available. A layer of waste materials is first laid in the pit. It is moistened with a suspension of 5-10 kg cow dung in 2.5 to 5.0 I of water and 0.5 to 1.0 kg fine bone meal sprinkled over it uniformly. Similar layers are laid one over the other till the material rises 0.75 m above the ground level. It is finally plastered with wet mud and left undisturbed for 8 to 10 weeks. Plaster is then removed, material moistened with water, given a turning and made into a rectangular heap under a shade. It is left undisturbed till its use.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the&nbsp;<strong>Indore method</strong>&nbsp;of composting, organic wastes are spread in the cattle shed to serve as bedding. Urine soaked material along with dung is removed every day and formed into a layer of about 15 cm thick at suitable sites. Urine soaked earth, scraped from cattle sheds is mixed with water and sprinkled over the layer of wastes twice or thrice a day. Layering process continued for about a fortnight. A thin layer of well decomposed compost is sprinkled over top and the heap given a turning and reformed. Old compost acts as inoculum for decomposing the material. The heap is left undisturbed for about a month. Then it is thoroughly moistened and given a turning. The compost is ready for application in another month.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the&nbsp;<strong>Bangalore method</strong>&nbsp;of composting, dry waste material of 25 cm thick is spread in a pit and a thick suspension of cow dung in water is sprinkled over for moistening. A thin layer of dry waste is laid over the moistened layer. The pit is filled alternately with dry layers of material and cow dung suspension till it rises 0.5 m above ground level. It is left exposed without covering for 15 days. It is given a turning, plastered with wet mud and left undisturbed for about 5 months or till required.</p>
        <p align="justify">In Coimbatore method, there is anaerobic decomposition to start with, following by aerobic fermentation. It is the reverse in Bangalore method. The Bangalore compost is not so thoroughly decomposed as the Indore compost or even as much as the Coimbatore compost, but it is bulkiest.</p>
        <p align="justify">          Compost  is a rich source of organic matter. Soil organic matter plays an important role  in sustaining soil fertility, and hence in sustainable agricultural production.  In addition to being a source of plant nutrient, it improves the  physico-chemical and biological properties of the soil. As a result of these  improvements, the soil: </p>
        <p align="justify">(i) becomes more resistant to stresses such as drought, diseases and toxicity;<br />
          (ii) helps the crop in improved uptake of plant nutrients; and <br />
        (iii) possesses an active nutrient cycling capacity because of vigorous microbial activity. </p>
        <p align="justify">These advantages manifest themselves in reduced cropping risks, higher yields and lower outlays on inorganic fertilizers for farmers.</p>

        <div align="justify">
          <ul>
            <li>By adding organic wastes such as sawdust,  wood shavings, coir pith, pine needles, and dry fallen leaves, while preparing  organic waste mixtures for composting, one can ensure that the compost produced  contains sufficient and long-lasting humus. However, gardeners often find that  where they use lignin-rich plant materials, the compost does not ripen rapidly.  A technique for making good compost from hard plant materials involves mixing lime  in a ratio of 5 kg per 1000 kg of waste material. Lime can be applied as dry  powder or after mixing with a sufficient quantity of water. Treatment with lime  enhances the process of decomposition of hard materials. </li>
            <li>Liming can enhance the  humification process in plant residues by enhancing microbial population and  activity and by weakening lignin structure. It also improves the humus quality  by changing the ratio of humic to fulvic acids and decreases the amount of  bitumen, which interferes with the decomposition process. Instead of lime,  powdered phosphate rock can be used in a ratio of 20 kg per 1 000 kg of organic  waste. Phosphate rock contains a lot of lime. The phosphates and micronutrients  contained in phosphate rock make composts rich in plant nutrients.</li>

(P solubilizers). These organisms, in the form of culture broth or water  suspension of biofertilizer products, can be sprinkled when the decomposing  material is turned after one month. By this time, the temperature of the  compost has also stabilized at about 35 &deg;C. As a result of this inoculation,  the N content of straw compost can be increased by up to 2 percent. In addition  to improving N content and the availability of other plant nutrients, these  additions help to reduce the composting time considerably.</div>

        <p align="left"><strong>The Benefits of Using Composts to Agriculture</strong></p>
        <p align="justify">Compost  has been considered as a valuable soil amendment for centuries. Most people are  aware that using composts is an effective way to increase healthy plant  production, help save money, reduce the use of chemical fertilizers, and  conserve natural resources. Compost provides a stable organic matter that  improves the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soils, thereby  enhancing soil quality and crop production. When correctly applied, compost has  the following beneficial effects on soil properties, thus creating suitable  conditions for root development and consequently promoting higher yield and  higher quality of crops.</p>
